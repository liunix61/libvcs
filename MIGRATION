# Migration notes

Migration and deprecation notes for libvcs are here, see {ref}`history` as well.

```{admonition} Welcome on board! 👋
1. 📌 For safety, **always** pin the package
2. 📖 Check the migration notes _(You are here)_
3. 📣 If you feel something got deprecated and it interrupted you - past, present, or future - voice your opinion on the [tracker].

   We want to make libvcs fun, reliable, and useful for users.

   API changes can be painful.

   If we can do something to draw the sting, we'll do it. We're taking a balanced approach. That's why these notes are here!

   (Please pin the package. 🙏)
